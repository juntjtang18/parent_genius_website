community.guidelines.title=Community Guidelines - Parent Genius AI
about-caption-34=The beginning of our story
about-caption-35=Every parent’s journey begins with a question:
about-caption-36=“Am I ready? Am I doing this right?”
about-caption-37=Download the App
about-caption-38=Parenting doesn't come with a manual
about-caption-39=Some are dreamers, full of hope as they imagine holding a child for the first time. Some are expecting hearts, learning to navigate the joy and nerves of pregnancy. Some are new nests, awake at 3AM with a crying baby in their arms. Others are foundation builders, setting boundaries with toddlers who are testing the world, or explorer guides, helping little ones take their first steps into school and independence.
about-caption-40=Parenting looks different for everyone, but one feeling is universal — the need for support, reassurance, and guidance that actually fits your life.
about-caption-41=That’s why we created GenParenting AI (formerly Genius Parenting AI).
about-caption-42=View Features
about-caption-43=Why we built this app
about-caption-44=We saw a gap. Too often, parents are given generic advice that doesn’t reflect their culture, personality,or stage of life. Parenting isn’t one‑size‑fits‑all.
about-caption-441=So we asked: What if parents had a tool that could meet them exactly where they are?
about-caption-45=A quiz that takes just 30 seconds to understand you.
about-caption-46=A community where parents connect, share, and grow together.
about-caption-47=An AI chat assistant that never sleeps, ready when nobody else can be.
about-caption-48=Tips and courses that are matched to your personality, not just your child’s age.
about-caption-49=We built GenParenting AI to be that partner. Not another “how‑to” manual, but a guide that listens first,             then responds in a way that feels personal, practical, and compassionate.
about-caption-50=Our Vision
about-caption-51=To empower parents with the knowledge, tools, and support they need to create loving,           supportive families that nurture growth, foster resilience, and inspire the next generation           to thrive with confidence, compassion, and curiosity.
about-caption-52=Our Mission
about-caption-53=Our mission is to provide parents with actionable insights, expert advice, and innovative           resources, helping them create nurturing environments where children can grow, thrive,           and develop the skills they need to succeed in life.
about-caption-54=Our logo & brand identity
about-caption-55=Our logo is more than design — it’s a symbol of what we believe in.
about-caption-56=The colors represent diversity, inclusivity, and the warmth of family love.
about-caption-57=The circular form mirrors the never‑ending journey of parenting — growth, connection, and new beginnings.
about-caption-58=The modern, clean style shows our commitment to keeping things simple and approachable.
about-caption-601=We began as Genius Parenting AI. As our mission grew global, we simplified to GenParenting AI — a name 			            that’s modern, memorable, and easy to find across platforms. Both names carry the same promise: 			            to make parenting easier, more personal, and deeply supportive.
about-caption-60=For every parent, at every stage
about-caption-61=The Dreamer
about-caption-62=Preparing emotionally and physically for parenthood.
about-caption-63=The Expecting Heart

seg-growth-top-caption-35=Every stage of childhood brings new growth — from first steps to first exams. Tracking milestones isn’t about comparison, but about celebrating progress and knowing when to support extra help.
seg-growth-top-caption-37=Download the App
seg-growth-top-caption-101=Why it matters
seg-growth-top-caption-102=Developmental psychology (Piaget, Erikson) shows that each stage brings unique opportunities and risks. Understanding where your child is helps you respond with empathy — not pressure.
seg-emotion-top-caption-34=Emotional Development
seg-emotion-top-caption-35=Raising a child isn’t just about milestones — it’s about emotions. Helping kids name, manage, and express their feelings sets the foundation for lifelong resilience and healthy relationships.
seg-emotion-top-caption-37=Download the App
seg-emotion-top-caption-101=Why it matters
seg-emotion-top-caption-102=Research from the Canadian Paediatric Society shows kids who grow up with strong emotional support       are more confident, less anxious, and better at problem-solving. Parents with high emotional       intelligence (EQ) raise kids who thrive not just in school, but in friendships and future workplaces.
