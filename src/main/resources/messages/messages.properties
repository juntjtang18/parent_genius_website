faq.title=Frequently Asked Questions
faq.question1=What is Genius Parenting?
faq.answer1=Genius Parenting is a support app made for international parents in Canada who are raising (or planning to raise) kids between two cultures.

faq.question2=Who is this app for?
faq.answer2=If you're an immigrant, newcomer, international student, or first-generation parent raising kids in Canada (or even expecting), this app is for you! Whether you're from Asia, Africa, Europe, Latin America, or anywhere else—you’ll find a home here.
faq.question3=How is this different from other parenting apps?

faq.question4=Is this app only for people who already have kids?
faq.answer4=Nope! If you're expecting or planning to have kids soon, you’re 100% welcome. We’ve got resources for you too—from preparing for parenthood in a new country to navigating early childhood.
faq.question5=Is my information safe?
faq.answer5=Absolutely. We don't sell your info. Your conversations, stories, and data are private and protected. Genius Parenting is built by real parents who care about trust, not by big corporations looking to cash in.
faq.question6=How much does it cost?
faq.answer6=Genius Parenting is free to download! Some premium tools (like personal coaching or workshops) might have a fee later, but basic features, advice, and community access will always be free.
faq.question7=What kind of help can I find on the app?

faq.question8=Can I connect with other parents like me?
faq.answer8=Yes! That’s a huge part of Genius Parenting. You can join community circles based on your child's age, your background, your city, or topics you care about.
faq.question9=I'm still learning English / French. Will that be a problem?
faq.answer9=Not at all! We are working toward offering multilingual support, starting with simple English, and expanding based on user needs. In future updates, you’ll be able to choose your preferred language for advice and tips.
